In any bipartite graph, the number of edges in a maximum matching equals the
number of vertices in a minimum vertex cover. To exhibit the vertex cover:
\begin{enumerate}
\itemsep-0.5em 
\item Find a maximum matching
\item Change each edge \textbf{used} in the matching into a directed edge from
\textbf{right to left}
\item Change each edge \textbf{not used} in the matching into a directed edge
from \textbf{left to right}
\item Compute the set $T$ of all vertices reachable from unmatched vertices on
the left (including themselves)
\item The vertex cover consists of all vertices on the right that are
\textbf{in} $T$, and all vertices on the left that are \textbf{not in} $T$
\end{enumerate}
